# Stack-on

A challenging tower builder game created with HTML5 Canvas, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Game Description

Stack-on is an addictive arcade-style game where the player stacks blocks to build the tallest tower possible. Blocks move horizontally across the screen, and the player must time their placement perfectly to stack them on top of each other. Any overhanging parts of the block fall off, making the tower increasingly narrow and challenging to build as the game progresses.

## How to Play

1. Press the "Start Game" button to begin
2. Watch the moving block carefully as it moves horizontally
3. Click anywhere on the screen or press the spacebar to drop the block
4. Successfully stack blocks to increase your score
5. Try to reach level 3 and beyond for the highest score

## Features

- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile devices
- Three progressive difficulty levels with increasing speed
- Local storage to save your high score
- Colorful block designs with subtle 3D effects
- Linear block movement with natural bouncing off the edges
- Alternating spawn points for blocks (left and right sides)

## Game Mechanics

- **Scoring**: Each successfully stacked block adds 1 point to your score
- **Levels**: 
  - Level 1: Initial speed (blocks 1-15)
  - Level 2: Moderate speed (blocks 16-30)
  - Level 3: Highest speed (blocks 31+)
- **Victory**: Reach 45 points to complete the game
- **Game Over**: Occurs when a block completely misses the tower

## Technical Implementation

The game is built using:
- HTML5 Canvas for rendering
- CSS for styling and animations
- JavaScript for game logic and interactions
- Responsive design that adapts to screen size
